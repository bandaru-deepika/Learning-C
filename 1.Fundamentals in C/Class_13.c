Const and Volatile Qualifiers

Const and volatile are two of the most important qualifiers in C. 
They are used to modify the meaning of a variable or a pointer. 
The const qualifier is used to indicate that a variable is constant and cannot be changed. 
The volatile qualifier is used to indicate that a variable may change at any time, and
 that the compiler should not make any assumptions about its value.

Const Qualifier:
- The const qualifier is used to indicate that a variable is constant and cannot be changed.

Syntax:
const <data type> <variable name> = <value>;

Example:
const int a = 10;

Volatile Qualifier:
- The volatile qualifier is used to indicate that a variable may change at any time, and
 that the compiler should not make any assumptions about its value.

Syntax:
volatile <data type> <variable name> = <value>;

Example:
volatile int a = 10;
